To design the API for the Library Management System backend, we'll need endpoints to perform CRUD operations on various entities such as books, library members, students, addresses, and book issuances. Below is a basic outline of the API requirements:

Books Endpoint: Done

GET /api/books/: Retrieve a list of all books.
POST /api/books/: Create a new book.
GET /api/books/{book_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific book.
PUT /api/books/{book_id}/: Update details of a specific book.
DELETE /api/books/{book_id}/: Delete a specific book.

Library Members Endpoint: Done

GET /api/members/: Retrieve a list of all library members.
POST /api/members/: Create a new library member.
GET /api/members/{member_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific library member.
PUT /api/members/{member_id}/: Update details of a specific library member.
DELETE /api/members/{member_id}/: Delete a specific library member.

Students Endpoint: Done

GET /api/students/: Retrieve a list of all students.
POST /api/students/: Create a new student.
GET /api/students/{student_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific student.
PUT /api/students/{student_id}/: Update details of a specific student.
DELETE /api/students/{student_id}/: Delete a specific student.

Addresses Endpoint:

GET /api/addresses/: Retrieve a list of all addresses.
POST /api/addresses/: Create a new address.
GET /api/addresses/{address_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific address.
PUT /api/addresses/{address_id}/: Update details of a specific address.
DELETE /api/addresses/{address_id}/: Delete a specific address.

Book Issuances Endpoint:

GET /api/issuances/: Retrieve a list of all book issuances.
POST /api/issuances/: Issue a book to a student.
GET /api/issuances/{issuance_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific book issuance.
PUT /api/issuances/{issuance_id}/: Update details of a specific book issuance (e.g., return a book).

PUT /api/fines/{fine_id}/: Update details of a specific fine.
DELETE /api/fines/{fine_id}/: Delete a specific fine.
This is a basic outline of the API requirements for the Library Management System backend. Depending on the specific features and requirements of your application, you may need to add more endpoints or additional functionalities.
